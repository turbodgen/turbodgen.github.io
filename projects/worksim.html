            <p>I just wanted to make something that would let you spam your keyboard and it would show something else, kind of like how
                <a href="https://hackertyper.net/" target="_blank">hackertyper.net</a> works. it's a very basic Pygame creation.

            <h2>Working Sim - 4/28/22</h2>
            <p>I was bored and I wanted to do something, so I decided to make a basic game. After like 5 minutes of thinking, I thought about 
                a basic Pygame game where you just spam your keyboard and it shows something on the screen. I quickly made an image in Ms Paint, 
                and then started coding.
            </p>
            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/turbodgen/amazing-work-game/main/Untitled.png" width="25%">
            <p>it was easy checking for input. All I did was add to an amount of characters to show every time a key was pressed. It would update
                the text every time there's an input. All I needed to do was to make a text wrapper. I made a text wrapper function which would
                return a list of labels. I used a for loop in the main loop to show them.
            </p>
            <p>That's all! It's very basic, and it's about 100 lines of code only. I might add to it, probably make the text fully automatic. Probably
                something like Lorem Ipsum
