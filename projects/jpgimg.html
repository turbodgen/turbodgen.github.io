        <h1>JPG Animation</h1>
        <div class="summ">
            <p>I randomly had a thought of making a gif creator that would destroy an image in an animation. I started it, then finished the images
                part 2 days later on 4/15/22. I wanted to make something that would destroy a whole video gradually, but it wasn't working.
            </p>
            <p>
                The image one is finished and fine, but I never finished the video one. I most likely won't finish it unless I get a random kick
                of motivation.

            <h2>Image JPG - 4/13/22 to 4/15/22</h2>
            <p>I started on April 13, 2022 with a basic idea of converting an image over and over again using Python PIL and using MoviePy to add
                all of the frames together. I made it so it would turn a PNG into a JPG, to a PNG, to a JPG, over and over again 100 times. It was
                a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.
            </p>
            <img src="../imgs/imgProj/jpgImg.gif" width="25%">
            <p>All I had to do then was use MoviePy to add all of the images. I decided to use 24 fps. I was basically finished after that! All I did
                then was make it lower the quality of the image so it takes less time, and added a random music clip over it. That was all!
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="summ">
            <h2>Video JPG - 4/16/22 to ???</h2>
            <p>Right after I finished the image one, I started with a video type thing. It was supposed to change the quality of the video gradually
                during the whole duration of the video. I got every frame of the video and tried to convert them to low quality JPG's. It was working
                at first, but randomly it stopped working. I don't know if I messed with it or what.
            </p>
            <p>For like 2 days it was me trying to troubleshoot it, but nothing I did was working. I have do idea what I did, and I decided to quit it
                for the time being. I don't know when I'll return to it.
