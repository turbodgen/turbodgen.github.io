            <p>I randomly thought about creating a website, since I wanted to learn about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I thought that there was
                no better way than creating a website about me and about coding.

            <h2>This Website - 5/21/22 to present.</h2>
            <p>I was watching a JavaScript video on YouTube, and saw some basic JavaScript code. I wrote it down and did some tinkering with it.
                I created a basic website with HTML and CSS with a JavaScript click counter in the middle. I thought about how I can make my own
                website, and I started soon after.

            <p>I created a basic structure for the website. I had a navigation bar on the top, which taught me how to use CSS, since it was so
                annoying trying to get it to work. After creating the basic pages, I used GitHub to put the site on the internet. I added to the
                Projects, About Me, and Contact tab, and I was mostly finished with the basics.
            </p>
            <p>Later, I started make little pages for my projects so you can learn about them more. The website is still updating, and it has been
                a good introduction to web development for me.
