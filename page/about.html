        <p>
            I've been coding for around 3-4 years, and I've (mostly) enjoyed it.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm best at Python, but I can also do C++, Java, Lua, and JavaScript. I'm not that good at web design.

        <h1>Coding "History"</h1>
        <p id="history">
            I started coding with Roblox, and I would mostly use tutorials. Sometimes, I would create small websites with the help of tutorials, then change some 
            stuff about it. There were small periods where I would try to branch out and learn C++ or Python,
             but they were pretty hard, so I would stick with Lua for a while, knowing some Python.
        </p>
        <p id="history">
            In the middle of 2021, I remembred about coding, and how iteresting
            it was, so I picked up Python again and started working with it for a few months. I learned Java, C++, and now, some HTML, CSS, and Javascript
