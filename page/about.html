            I've been coding for around 3-4 years, and I've (mostly) enjoyed it.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm best at python, but I can also do C++, Java, and Javascript. I'm not that good at web design.

        <h1>"History"</h1>
        <p>
            I started coding with Roblox, and I would mostly use tutorials. There were small periods where I would try to branch out<br> and learn C++ or Python, but 
            they were pretty hard, so I would stick with Lua for a while, knowing some Python.<br><br> In the middle of 2021, I remembred about coding, and how iteresting
            it was, so I picked up <br>Python again and started working with it for a few months. I learned Java, C++, and now, some HTML, CSS, and Javascript
